# /* TASK:

1. - You need to create a body mass index (BMI) calculator.

2. - Body mass index is calculated using the formula:
weight in kg / height squared.

For example, a person’s mass = 74 kg, height = 172 cm. Therefore, the body mass index in this case is equal to:
BMI = 74kg / 1.722m² ≈ 25.01 kg/m²
